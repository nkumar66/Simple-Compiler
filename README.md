# Simple-Compiler
A simple compiler with a recursive descent parser using Lexical Analysis, built to tokenize and analyze input code efficiently. 


Extended Description:

This project is a simple compiler that performs Lexical Analysis to tokenize input code for the Recursive Descent Parser. 
It processes source code into meaningful tokens, which can be further parsed for syntax validation. Built using C++, the compiler
demonstrates key concepts of compiler design, including tokenization, regular expressions, and symbol table management.
